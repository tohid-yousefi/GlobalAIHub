{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Naive Bayes - GlobalAIHub\n","\n","üìå The main aim of classification is, to find the class corresponding to a given feature set. The **Naive Bayes** classifier algorithm is based on a famous theorem called **‚ÄúBayes theorem‚Äù** which is centered on conditional probability. Conditional probability is the probability of an event ‚ÄòA‚Äô happening given that another event ‚ÄòB‚Äô has already happened. For example, consider event ‚ÄòA‚Äô to be ‚Äúhaving a fever‚Äù, and event ‚ÄòB‚Äô to be ‚Äúinfected with Covid-19‚Äù. With conditional probability, we can ask the question: what is the chance of having a fever given that you have been infected with Covid-19.\n","\n","üìå The Bayes‚Äô theorem is an extension of conditional probability. In a sense, it allows us to use reverse reasoning. The Naive Bayes algorithm does the same for the class and its features. Instead of calculating the probability of a feature belonging to a class, it approaches the issue from another angle. \n","\n","üìå There are three types of Naive Bayes Classifiers in sklearn; **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**, **Multinomial Naive Bayes** and **Gaussian Naive Bayes**. We use Bernoulli Naive Bayes when our data is binary like true or false, yes or no and so on. We use Multinomial Naive Bayes when we have discrete values such as number of family members or, pages in a book. We use Gaussian Naive Bayes when all of our features are continuous variables, like temperature or height. Let‚Äôs take the dataset on tumors from our classification session, which only has continuous variables. We use the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm. As always, we start with importing the Pandas library for reading our data file. Then we can read and display the first few rows of the dataset."],"metadata":{"id":"VgAxNwpqFS1q"},"id":"VgAxNwpqFS1q"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"1c0d313d","metadata":{"id":"1c0d313d"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as
