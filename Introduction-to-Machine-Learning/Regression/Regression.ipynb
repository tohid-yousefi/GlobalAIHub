Regression models are helpful for predicting numerical values based on different features‚Äô values. For example, temperature forecast based on wind, humidity and pressure, or price estimations of a car based on its model year, brand, and transmission type. In regression, we want to build a relationship between each feature and the output so that we can predict for example, the price of the house when we know the features but not the price. If this relationship is linear, this algorithm is called linear regression.\n","\n","üìå **Linear regression** is perhaps the most well-known and well-understood algorithm in statistics and machine learning. A simple linear regression model tries to explain the relationship between the two variables using a best fitting straight line.
