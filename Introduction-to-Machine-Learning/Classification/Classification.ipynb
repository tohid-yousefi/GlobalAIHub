Here, the classes act as our labels, or ground truth. A classification model uses the features of an object to predict its labels. As we say labels, you can probably guess that here we have another **supervised learning** model at hand. The algorithm used by your email service providers to filter spam from non-spam emails is an example of classification. This model uses the features of the email: subject, sender’s email address, email body, and attachments as inputs; and makes a prediction for one out of the two classes: spam or non-spam. This is an example of *binary classification*, where the output is restricted to two classes. Spam and non-spam, true and false, zeros and ones, yes and no, positive, or negative and so on. If there are more than two classes, we have a **multi-class classification** problem. An example of multi-class classification can be classifying types of fruits based on their color, weight, and size. Or movies into different genres like comedy, romance, drama, and horror.\n","\n","📌 The question is, how can machine learning solve this problem? Let’s start with our first classification model: **Logistic regression**. The best way to think about logistic regression is that it is a *linear regression* but for classification problems. Logistic regression uses a logistic function, specifically the **Sigmoid function**. This function takes any real input, and outputs a value between zero and one. Unlike linear regression, logistic regression doesn’t need a linear relationship between input and output variables. Once we have the predicted results from our classification model, or classifier, we compare these results with the actual label, the ground truth, and evaluate the performance of our model."],"metadata":{"id":"W13hDBlCan8p"},"id":"W13hDBlCan8p"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["📌 We have a binary classification problem. We need to classify tumors into malignant ones that are cancerous or benign which means non-cancerous. Our dataset contains statistical data from histopathology examinations. We will use this dataset to train our logistic regression model. Let’s import pandas and read the dataset. Using the shape method, we can easily get the number of observations and features. In this dataset, there are unique instances. The features are radius mean, texture mean, radius worst, and so on. There are features in total. We can check the first 5 instances in our dataset using the head function. Here, we can see, the first column represents the target variable.

machine learning algorithms to it, it has to be cleaned and organized. Since we know that machines operate with numbers, we need to convert our target variable from categorical to numerical type. There are many ways to do this. One of the simpler methods is called **label encoding**. With this, we can convert “M” and “B” to 1 and 0. As a first step, we import **LabelEncoder** from **sklearn** library. Then, to make it easier to use, we assign LabelEncoder to the “labelencoder” variable.

We have actually trained and tested a logistic regression classifier. Now, why not try another classification algorithm: **Support Vector Machine**. *SVM* is a **supervised machine learning technique** that can be used to solve classification and regression problems. It is, however, mostly used for classification. In this algorithm, we use an axis to represent each feature and plot all data points in the space. Then, the SVM model finds boundaries to separate these classes. The decision boundary is what separates different data samples into specific classes. Consider a dataset of different animals of two classes: birds and fish. In this dataset there are only three features: body weight, body length, and daily food consumption. We draw a 3-dimensional grid and plot all these points. A SVM model will try to find a 2D plane that differentiates the 2 classes.\n","\n","📌 If there were more than 3 features, we would have a hyper-space. A hyper-space is a space with higher than 3 dimensions like 4D, 5D, and so on and therefore it is not possible to visualize. We can find a hyper-plane that clearly distinguishes different classes. Hyper-planes are multidimensional planes that exist in four or more dimensions. This hyper-plane is used as a condition to perform classification.

Now, we can check the accuracy of our model in the same way we did for Logistic Regression. We can start with the confusion matrix. We have one hundred one true negatives, 2 false positives, 4 false negatives, 64 true positives. This means that 165 out of 171 predictions are correct, just a couple less than before.
